    "# Descriptive statistics\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that involves the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data to provide a summary or description of the main features of a dataset. It is primarily focused on revealing patterns, trends, and key characteristics of the data, making it easier to understand and draw meaningful conclusions from the information at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics encompasses various statistical measures and techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measures of Central Tendency:** These measures indicate where the center of the data is and include the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequently occurring value).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measures of Dispersion:** These measures describe the spread or variability of the data and include variance and standard deviation. They help assess how data points differ from the central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Visualization:** Graphical representations like histograms, box plots, and scatterplots are used to visually represent data, making it easier to spot patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Percentiles and Quartiles:** These divide data into percentile groups, helping to understand the relative position of data points within the dataset.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Percentiles** and **Quartiles** are statistical measures used to divide a dataset into equal parts or to identify specific data points' relative positions within a dataset. They are often used in various fields, including education, healthcare, finance, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Percentiles**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Percentiles divide a dataset into 100 equal parts. For example, the 25th percentile (P25) represents the value below which 25% of the data falls.\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  1. In educational testing, percentiles are used to compare a student's performance with a reference group.\n",
    "  2. In healthcare, growth percentiles are used to track children's development.\n",
    "  3. In finance, they help assess an investment's performance compared to others.\n",
    "  4. In salary analysis, percentiles determine where an individual's income stands relative to a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quartiles**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Quartiles divide a dataset into four equal parts. There are three quartiles: Q1, Q2 (the median), and Q3.\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  1. In box plots, quartiles help visualize the spread of data.\n",
    "  2. In statistical analysis, they are used to measure data dispersion.\n",
    "  3. In healthcare, quartiles help evaluate patient data.\n",
    "  4. In finance, they provide insights into investment risk and return.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Percentile Example**:\n",
    "Consider a dataset of 20 test scores: 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145.\n",

    "   - Sort the data in ascending order.\n",

    "2. **Second Quartile (Q2)**:\n",

    "3. **Third Quartile (Q3)**:\n",
