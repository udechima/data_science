    "\n",
    "**Meaning:** Limits are a foundational concept in calculus, allowing us to understand what happens to a function as it approaches a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1). To find the limit of this function as x approaches 1, we simplify the expression by canceling the common factor (x - 1) in the numerator and denominator. The limit as x approaches 1 is 2, which means that as x gets arbitrarily close to 1, the function's value gets arbitrarily close to 2.\n"
