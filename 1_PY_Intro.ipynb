    "Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs. Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level `data types` built in, such as flexible `arrays` and `dictionaries`. Because of its more general `data types` Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than other high-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively (think `jupyter` notebooks), which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also highly extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments in Python start with the hash character, `#`, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. \n",
